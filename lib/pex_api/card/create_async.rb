      ##
      # Create cards for the business. The response to this call is a CardOrderId.
      # To retrieve card details, including the card AccountId, use GET /Card/CardOrder/{Id}
      #
      # NOTE: - Cards have an expiration date of 3 years and will renew automatically 60 days prior to expiration. If the card expiration is 01/17, the card will expire on the last day of the month, January 31, 2017.
      #       - non-ASCII characters. Ex: "Ã±" not allowed
      #
      #       - If PEX card is used for fuel authorizations, transit passes or online purchases, there will be times where the cardholder will have to key in the billing zip code as it appears on the cardholder profile. To avoid issues at the time of purchase, let the cardholder know what their billing (i.e. profile) address is.
      #       - If the cardholder enters an invalid Zip Code 2 times, the merchant may refuse to accept additional card swipes. If this occurs, cardholders will have to see the attendant to complete a gas transaction, or use another form of payment.
      #       - If the cardholder should have access to dashboard.pexcard.com to review their transaction history, etc., they will need the four (4) digit year of birth from their profile. If you are using a generic value, you will need to convey that to the cardholder.
      #
      # SPENDING LIMITS:
      #   To add spend rules to a card account, use GET /SpendingRuleset to retrieve all the Spend rule sets for your business. 
      #   At card creation, the spend rule defaults are:
      #     - Daily spend limit is NONE
      #     - International spending is OFF
      #     - Card-not-present spending is ON
      #     - All merchant categories are ON.
      #
      # GROUPS:
      #   To add a card account to a group, use GET /Group to retrieve GroupIds
